# Identix 

**Identix** is a modern identity and access management company focused on delivering secure, scalable, and developer-friendly authentication infrastructure. Our mission is to simplify how applications handle login, authorization, identity verification, and Single Sign-On across platforms.

We build tools and services that enable developers to integrate OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and enterprise-grade IAM features without reinventing authentication from scratch.
